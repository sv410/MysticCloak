#mysticCloak#
This Harry Potter-inspired invisibility cloak project uses computer vision to create a real-time invisibility effect. The app captures your background, detects a specific cloak color, and seamlessly blends the covered areas to make you disappear just like magic. Features include real-time color detection, adjustable sensitivity, and a beautiful magical interface with floating particles and gradients.
